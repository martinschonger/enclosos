### Setup
Install MATLAB (tested with R2023a).

Install the MathWorks toolboxes
[Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image-processing.html),
[Optimization Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html),
[Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html), and
[Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html).

### Usage
Run `enclosos.mlapp`.

Configure the parameters via the GUI as desired, hit the "compute" button, and check the result in the figure window.

Optionally, make adjustments and recompute as needed.

Optionally, save the computed polynomial to an m-file.
